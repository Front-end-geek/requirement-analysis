#TASK 0
Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This project aims to sharpen skills essential for managing and delivering robust software systems by focusing on the cornerstone of successful development: Requirement Analysis.

#TASK 1: Define Requirement Analysis
What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
 This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

#TASK 2: 
Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

 Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

#TASK 3:
Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
REQUIREMENT GATHERING
Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

REQUIREMENT ELICITATION
Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTATION
Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.
Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

REQUIREMENT VALIDATION
Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

TASK 4:
Types of Requirements.

Functional Requirements
Hotel management: hotel managers can manage hotel information. In addition, hotel managers can access and update hotel details.
Customer service
 customers can search gor hotels based on location and price.
 Customers can view  hotel recommendations , booking information and updates and make payments.
 View Booking service
 This feature can retrieve and display current and historical booking details for customers and managers

 Non functional requirements
 Scalability: Use microservice architecture to handle high user traffic and scale services independently.
 Performance:
 Implement Redis caching for fast data retrieval.
Use Elasticsearch for optimized search queries
Security:
Secure API requests for hotel management, booking, and payments.
Ensure safe handling of customer payment data using third-party payment services.
Reliability:
Ensure high availability using load balancers and master-slave database replication.
Implement a messaging queue system for reliable data processing.
Usability
Deliver smooth and intuitive UI/UX for customer and manager portals.

TASK 5
Use Case Diagrams.
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to 
achieve specific goals (use cases).

Importance
Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.

TASK 6:
Acceptance Criteria.
Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders.
Importance of acceptance criteria in requirement analysis
Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
Provide a basis for testing and validation.
Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
